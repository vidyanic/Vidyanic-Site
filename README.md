## 🌟 What is Vidyanic?

**Vidyanic** is a unified framework for understanding reality across ALL knowledge fields—physics, biology, consciousness, and beyond. It bridges ancient Vedic wisdom with modern scientific discoveries, revealing the fractal patterns that connect everything.

## 🔮 Core Discoveries

### 1. The 15-Entity Framework
Every structure in reality follows: **7+ Emissive + 15th Observer + 7- Absorptive = 15 Total**

### 2. Independent Emergence
Each level of reality emerges independently—this is the source of FREE WILL.

### 3. Fractal Architecture
The same patterns repeat at every scale: from atoms to galaxies, from cells to consciousness.
